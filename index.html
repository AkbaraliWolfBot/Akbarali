    Modern Samarkand is divided into two parts: the old city, and the new city developed 
    during the days of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. The old city includes historical 
    monuments, shops and old private houses, while the new city includes administrative 
    buildings along with cultural centres and educational institutions.
